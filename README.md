# pattern-clustering-unsupervised-classification
Few clustering techniques and methods on continuous numerical data

In this repository, you will find three notebooks as per the following;
1. moons_and_circles_exercise.ipynb: it is an exercise where I have implemented different clustering methods (such as K-Means and DBScan), Outlier Detection using Isolation Forest and have done Principle Component Analysis (PCA).
2. wine_clustering.ipynb: in this notebook I am using Wine dataset from UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository [[1]](#1), to do clustering/unsupervised learning into its 3 classes, PCA and Logistic Regression.
3. countries_clusters.ipynb: In this notebook I have done clustering and PCA analysis to categorise each sample into one of the three categories:

| S.No      | Categories |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 1   | under-developing country |
| 2   | developing country       |
| 3   | developed country        |
